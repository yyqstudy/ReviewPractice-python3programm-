Write code that uses iteration to print out the length of each element of the list stored in str_list.

str_list = ["hello", "", "goodbye", "wonderful", "I love Python"]    
for str in str_list:
    print(len(str))
    
#output
5
0
7
9
13
(真的要经常复习，course1上完一周后不看会代码，最基本对都忘光了@@）

Using the file school_prompt2.txt, 
find the number of characters in the file and assign that value to the variable num_char.

fileref = open("school_prompt2.txt",'r')
num_char = 0
for char in fileref.read():
    num_char += 1
print(num_char)  

#output 537

Find the number of lines in the file, travel_plans2.txt, and assign it to the variable num_lines.

fileref = open("travel_plans2.txt",'r')
contents = fileref.readlines()
num_lines = 0
for lin in contents:
    num_lines += 1
print(num_lines) 

Create a string called first_forty that is comprised of the first 40 characters of emotion_words2.txt.

fileref = open("emotion_words2.txt",'r')
first_forty = fileref.read()[:40]
print(first_forty)

#output
Sad upset blue down melancholy somber bi

write code to find out how many lines are in the file emotion_words.txt as shown above. 
Save this value to the variable num_lines. Do not use the len method.

fileref = open("emotion_words.txt",'r')
num_lines = 0
for lin in fileref.readlines():
    num_lines += 1
print(num_lines)    


All absolute file paths start with "/
    
Create a list called destination using the data stored in travel_plans.txt. 
Each element of the list should contain a line from the file that lists a country and cities inside that country.
Hint: each line that has this information also has a colon : in it.

fileref = open("travel_plans.txt",'r')
lines = fileref.readlines()
#ll = lines.strip()
destination = lines[2:8]
print(destination)

Create a list called j_emotions that contains every word in emotion_words.txt that begins with the letter “j”.

fileref = open("emotion_words.txt",'r')
lines = fileref.read()
#print(lines)
words = lines.split()
#print(words)
j_emotions = []
for w in words:   
    if w[0] is 'j':
        j_emotions.append(w)
print(j_emotions) 

#output
['joyous', 'jittery', 'jumpy']
To be continue...
    
1.Create a list of numbers 0 through 40 and assign this list to the variable numbers.
Then, accumulate the total of the list’s values and assign that sum to the variable sum1.

numbers = range(41)
#print(numbers)
sum1 = 0
for num in numbers:
    sum1 = sum1 + num
print(sum1)    
#居然忘了range

2.Find the number of lines in the file, travel_plans2.txt, and assign it to the variable num_lines.

rfile = open('travel_plans2.txt','r')
content = rfile.readlines()
#print(content)
num_lines = 0
for str in content:
    num_lines = num_lines + 1
print(num_lines)  
#关于file的又忘记了，要复习啦,好像可以用len函数^_^
